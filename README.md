# Portfolio Challenge

This challenge forms part of the course work for week 2, Module 2 set by the University of Birmingham and Trilogy Ltd's Coding Bootcamp. 



## Project Description

The aim of this challenge was to create a portfolio website, from scratch, using HTML, CSS flexbox, media queries and variables. 


## Project Requirements


In addition to following the Scout Rule (leave the code cleaner than when you found it), the following user story and acceptance criteria  needed to be met:

### User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

```

### Image of Mock-Up Website

The following animation was provided as an example to show the web application's appearance and functionality needed to meet the criteria of this challenge.
